# Getting Started
This is a journey intended for Web Developers joining Code413 so that the team shares a common knowledge foundation and has a synchronized workflow.

## Master the Fundamentals
- Laravel is the core of our tech stack. Master [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/).
- Go through the [Object-Oriented Bootcamp](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-bootcamp-in-php).
- Learn [SOLID Principles in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php).

## Get Comfortable with Our Tools
- Watch [Git Me Some Version Control](https://laracasts.com/series/git-me-some-version-control).
- [Learn Laravel Mix](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-mix).
- [Learn Laravel Forge](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-forge).

## Match Our Style
- We use the `laravel` preset from [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) to format our code. This continuously fixes the styling issues of our repositories after each commit. If you use PHPStorm as your IDE, you can choose the `laravel` preset under `Settings > Editor > Code Style > PHP` to minimize the differences of styling between your local code and the remote repository. 
- Similarly, we use the default presets of StyleCI for formatting our JavaScript and CSS code.

## Level Up
- Learn to [Whip Monstrous Code Into Shape](https://laracasts.com/series/whip-monstrous-code-into-shape) and explore other [Clean Code](https://laracasts.com/topics/clean-code) series from Laracasts.
- Get familiar with the [Testing Jargon](https://laracasts.com/series/testing-jargon).
- Learn [Testing Laravel](https://laracasts.com/series/phpunit-testing-in-laravel).
- Watch [Build A Laravel App With TDD](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd).
- Watch [Cruddy by Design by Adam Wathan](https://youtu.be/MF0jFKvS4SI). We often use this approach in structuring our controllers, routes, and views.
